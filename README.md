# Data Exploration and Cleaning with MS SQL

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates advanced SQL techniques for data exploration and cleaning using Microsoft SQL Server. It focuses on two datasets: Covid-19 data for exploration and Housing data for cleaning.

## Datasets
1. Covid-19 Dataset: Used for data exploration
2. Housing Dataset: Used for data cleaning

## Skills Demonstrated

### Data Exploration (Covid-19 Dataset)
- Complex Joins
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Temporary Tables
- Window Functions
- Aggregate Functions
- Creating Views

### Data Cleaning (Housing Dataset)
- Converting Data Types
- Handling NULL values
- Standardizing Data
- Removing Duplicates
- Breaking out Address into Individual Columns

## Key SQL Techniques Used
- JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER)
- CTE (Common Table Expressions)
- Temporary Tables
- Window Functions (e.g., ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK())
- Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, COUNT)
- CASE statements
- Subqueries
- Data Type Conversions
- String manipulations
- Date manipulations

## Project Structure
1. Data Exploration
   - Covid-19 data analysis
   - Queries for infection rates, death percentages, vaccination rates
   - Visualization-ready query outputs

2. Data Cleaning
   - Housing data cleanup
   - Standardizing date formats
   - Populating missing property addresses
   - Breaking down address into individual columns (Address, City, State)
   - Changing Y and N to Yes and No in "Sold as Vacant" field
   - Removing duplicates
   - Deleting unused columns

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have Microsoft SQL Server installed
2. Import the Covid-19 and Housing datasets into your SQL Server
3. Run the exploration queries on the Covid-19 data
4. Execute the cleaning scripts on the Housing data
5. Analyze the results and use them for further processing or visualization

## Requirements
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Basic understanding of SQL queries
- Access to Covid-19 and Housing datasets
